## *** WORK IN PROGRESS ***
Current status: access control issues needs fixing.
Ported probably everything; untested. Will start testing. 

## Aim
This project aims to update/port iOS-GPX-Framework to Swift language, due to its original code being seemingly abandoned.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project will be more than welcomed. Feel free to add a pull request or open an issue.

## Installation

When completed, GPXKit will be available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby

Right now, GPXKit can be added to your project, by adding the following line to your Podfile.
