## *** WORK IN PROGRESS ***
Current status: Tons of debugging required.

## Aim
This project aims to update/port iOS-GPX-Framework to Swift language, due to its original code being seemingly abandoned.
Once the project reaches stability (if it ever will), I will focus on attempting to optimise the code and/or to add new features.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project will be more than welcomed. Feel free to add a pull request or open an issue.

## Installation

When completed, GPXKit will be available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'GPXKit'
```

Right now, as I do not wish to have people not being able to use this pod, due to critical errors, GPXKit can be added to your project for testing purposes only, by adding the following line to your Podfile.
```ruby
pod 'GPXKit', :git => 'https://github.com/VincentNeo/GPXKit.git'
```
